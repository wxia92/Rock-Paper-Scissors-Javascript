# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Javascript
Rock Paper Scissors App by William Xia

Description:
This app is a one player Rock Paper Scissors game between the player and the computer. Players make their selection by selecting the rock, paper, or scissors button. The game is first to 5 wins, and must be reset in order to continue afterward.

What I Learned:
The main takeaway from this project for me is learning to manipulate DOM through event listeners and property selectors. I was able to create the scoreboard and keep it updated by using the textContent property. I was also able to add images representing rock, paper, and scissors, based on what the user selected. In the case of the computer hand display, I used the template literal expression to set the url of the image src to the hand.
